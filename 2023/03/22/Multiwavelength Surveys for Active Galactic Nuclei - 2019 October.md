<u>**And I only wrote down what interests me. Sorry for the uncompletedness.**</u>



**Simple conclusion:**

<u>AGNs researches are shaped by how we find them. Different science in different band.</u>

#### Big 20-year

Successes:

​	AGNs $\leftrightarrow$ cosmic backgrounds

​	SMBH growth

​	evolution

​	high z, reionization

​	AGN-galaxy and AGN-LSS connections



#### Brief Introduction

Multiple methods $\rightarrow$ complete sample, robust conclusion

X-ray surveys $\rightarrow$ wide, medium, deep



Challenges: host galaxies



Deceiving appearance:

​	Anisotropic Obscuration, e.g., Torus; also outflow and disk obscuration anisotropy

​	Anisotropic Emission, e.g., Blazars; also accretion disk



#### Current Surveys

##### Ground-Based survey

optical, NIR/MIR, and Radio Windows

most find in those band



​	**Optical/NIR Color Selection**

​	<u>unobscured quasars</u>: e.g., UV excess

​	<u>Higher redshifts</u>: IGM, very red in blue part ---- color diagram

​	**Emission-Line and Variability Selection**

​	strong emission lines

​	**<u>optical variability</u>**: *De Cicco et al. 2019*; more powerful in the future $\rightarrow$ How can we distinct AGNs with variable stars?

​	**Exceptional Quasars from Optical/NIR**

Heavily Reddened and Luminous Type 1 Quasars

Type 2 Quasars

...

>  Summary: odd properties in OP/NIR, intensity , EWs, ... 



##### Radio Surveys for AGNs

high incompleteness, only ~10% of AGNs have radio luminosities

v.s. star-forming galaxies, ...

> Panessa et al. 2019

​	**Key Points**

​	Why a minority of AGNs launch powerful jets? 

​	power low $\rightarrow$ no z info

​	Affected by beaming



​	**Advantage**

​	is not dust-extincted. 

​	<u>**find different AGN populations**</u> (radio loud, but lack optical signatures)



##### Space-based Surveys

Expensive and advanced.

Offer some fantastic advantages.

​	**X-ray Survey Advantages**

​	<u>universal</u>, corona and sometimes jets

​	<u>**low obscuration bias**</u>

​	low dilution by host-galaxy starlight



​	**Deep and Wide X-ray Surveys**	

​	Note. X-rays span a very broad band.

​	**Key points**

​	selection, purity

​	highest AGN sky density

​	redshift are rare, not precise



##### Gamma-ray Surveys

​	Fermi LAT(50 MeV-1 TeV), HESS(0.1-100 TeV)

​	blazars, also some radio galaxies

​	poor for general, but good for extreme jet physics



##### MIR/FIR AGN Surveys

​	dust

​	**MIR Selection:**

​		color-selection recipes

​		obscuration-free, especially beyond rest-frame ~ $\rm 6 \mu m$; <u>**even highly obscured AGNs missed in X-ray surveys**</u>

​	**Disadvantages:**

​		contamination by star-forming galaxies

​		not very "pure"



#### Prospects

* growth and feedback of highly obscured SMBHs through the z 1~4 galaxy formation era



* SMBH growth in the first galaxies at z 6-10 and the z 10-15 seeds of SMBHs



* Deeper understanding of AGN-galaxy and AGN-LSS connections



* Complete our understanding of GAN obscuration



Powerful Wide-Field AGN Surveys Coming, such as LSST (z ~ 9-10)

Deep-Field survey



An enormous need for AGN spectra

Thankfully, photometric redshifts and narrow-band photometric
