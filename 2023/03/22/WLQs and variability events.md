This talk was about the observation of weak line quasars and  their properties in X-ray band. And it also pointed out some possible explanations. 

Also, it mentioned X-ray variability events of those WLQs, involving a extreme example (less than 2 days). 



weak-line

luminous type 1 quasars

remarkably large blueshifts

 

Properties of WLQs:

- half, X-ray Weak

- half, hard average spectra

- X-ray normal half have steep     power laws

- - high $\dot{m}_{edd}$

 

Discussion

thick inner disks, line of sight ---- different WLQs

 

Interesting fact ---- variability, and also very rapid variability

---- disk wind?
